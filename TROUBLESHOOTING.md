# Troubleshooting "Failed to fetch" Error in Supabase Image Gallery

## Problem
Users are getting "Error al registrarse: Failed to fetch" when trying to register.

## Root Cause Analysis
The Supabase connection test was successful (HTTP 200 OK), which means:
1. ✅ Supabase project is active and accessible
2. ✅ API key is valid
3. ✅ Network connectivity is working

The issue is likely **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** related. When the browser makes a registration request from your local development server to Supabase, it needs proper CORS headers.

## Solutions

### 1. Check Supabase CORS Settings
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → API
3. Under "CORS Configuration", add your development URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (if using a local server)
   - `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
   - `file://` (if running directly from file system)

### 2. Serve the Application Properly
Running HTML files directly from the file system (`file://` protocol) can cause CORS issues. Instead:

**Option A: Use a Local Development Server**
```bash
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server 3000

# If you have Node.js installed
npx serve .

# If you have PHP installed
php -S localhost:3000
```

**Option B: Use Live Server Extension in VSCode**
1. Install the "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

### 3. Verify Browser Console
Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and check:
- Console tab for detailed error messages
- Network tab to see the failed requests

### 4. Test Registration with Enhanced Error Logging
The updated `app.js` now includes:
- Detailed error logging to console
- Better user-friendly error messages
- Connection testing on app startup

## Current Configuration
- **Supabase URL**: `https://jdtkgjunxdspmgbbmsdq.supabase.co`
- **Status**: ✅ Active and accessible
- **Connection Test**: ✅ Successful (HTTP 200)

## Next Steps
1. Serve the application using a proper local server (not file://)
2. Check browser console for detailed error messages
3. Verify Supabase CORS settings include your development URL
4. Test registration again

## Common CORS Error Patterns
- `Access to fetch at 'https://...' from origin 'null' has been blocked`
- `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource`

If you see these errors, it confirms the CORS issue that needs to be resolved in Supabase dashboard settings.
