# Project Update Plan

## Tasks Completed:

### SQL Schema Updates:
1. [x] Add user_profiles table for additional user information
2. [x] Add user_registrations table to track registration details  
3. [x] Add login_history table to track login attempts and sessions
4. [x] Add RLS policies for all new tables
5. [x] Add automatic profile creation trigger
6. [x] Add simplified login tracking function

### Frontend Updates:
1. [x] Add login attempt tracking (success/failure)
2. [x] Add registration tracking in user_registrations table
3. [x] Handle error cases properly

## Issues Fixed:
- Removed problematic functions that tried to access request headers
- Simplified SQL functions to work with Supabase environment
- Added proper error handling in frontend authentication
- Cleaned up unused columns from tables (registration_ip, user_agent, login_ip)
- Simplified schema for better reliability
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed RLS policies to allow users to insert their own registration and login records (was only allowing admin inserts)

## Next Steps:
1. Execute the updated SQL schema in Supabase SQL editor
2. Test registration functionality - new users should automatically get profiles
3. Test login functionality - both success and failure should be tracked
4. Verify data appears in user_profiles, user_registrations, and login_history tables
5. Check that existing image upload functionality still works
